## Development

> 💡 Octane is configured to run in watch mode - backend changes are picked up automatically with no server restart needed.

### Frontend

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
```

### Queues (Horizon)

Background jobs are processed by [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon), which manages the Redis queue workers and provides a monitoring dashboard at `/horizon`.

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan horizon        # start the Horizon workers
./vendor/bin/sail artisan horizon:status # check the master supervisor status
```

Worker supervisors, queues, and balancing strategies are configured in `config/horizon.php`. Dashboard access is authorized via the `viewHorizon` gate.

#### Horizon on staging

Not reachable from the public internet: `HORIZON_DOMAIN` in the server-side `.env` scopes Horizon's routes to the tailnet hostname, so they are never registered on the public FQDN. The `handle /horizon*` block in `deploy/Caddyfile.staging` is optional defense in depth.

### Code Style (Pint)

Uses extensive custom rules defined in `pint.json` - including `declare_strict_types`, `final_class`, `strict_comparison`, `ordered_class_elements`, and more. See `pint.json` for the full ruleset.

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint                    # fix all files
./vendor/bin/pint --dirty            # fix only uncommitted files
./vendor/bin/pint --test             # dry-run (report without fixing)
```

### Static Analysis (Larastan)

Runs at **level 8** (out of 10). Configuration in `phpstan.neon`.

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G
```

### Automated Refactoring (Rector)

Uses [Driftingly/Laravel Rector](https://github.com/driftingly/rector-laravel) with Laravel-specific rule sets and prepared sets for dead code, code quality, type declarations, privatization, and early returns. Configuration in `rector.php`.

```bash
./vendor/bin/rector --dry-run          # preview changes without applying
./vendor/bin/rector                    # apply changes
```

### Tests

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test                                              # all tests
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact                                    # compact output
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --parallel                                   # run tests in parallel (faster)
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --parallel --compact                         # parallel + compact output
./vendor/bin/sail pest --filter "switches locale when locale is available"  # specific test
./vendor/bin/sail pest tests/Unit/LocaleSwitchTest.php                      # specific file
```

#### Browser tests (Playwright)

Browser tests live in `tests/Browser` and drive a real Chromium instance via Playwright. The browser binaries must be installed inside the Sail container once (they live in the container filesystem, so reinstall after a container rebuild):

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npx playwright install chromium               # download the Chromium binary
docker compose exec -u root checkin npx playwright install-deps chromium  # install system libraries (as root)
```

Then run the browser suite:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test tests/Browser                    # all browser tests
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --parallel tests/Browser         # browser tests in parallel
```
